This project is a sales performance dashboard designed for a business,  using Power BI. 

This project is a Sales Performance Dashboard that provides a comprehensive overview of sales data across different regions, product categories, and time periods. The dashboard includes key metrics such as total sales by year, product count per category, total quantity sold, and customer count. It also highlights sales trends on a monthly basis and customer preferences across different product categories.

The data is segmented by regions and Product categories, analyzed to show contribution to total sales and quantity sold. The dashboard also provides insights into average sales per order, total tax amount, and total freight costs.

I worked on this project using a star schema data model, which optimized data retrieval and improved the performance of the dashboard.
